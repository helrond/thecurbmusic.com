                Did some junior detective steal it out of spite<br>
                Or did it end up drifting through the starry, starry night</p>

            <p>They say Vincent was crazy and it might have been the truth<br>
              His style was unconventional his manner was uncouth<br>
              Failure was his standard and loss his destiny<br>
              He was not a darling of the petty bourgeoisie</p>
            <p>He loved the sun and sunflowers he loved his cousin<br>
              He painted portraits of the entire family Roulin<br>
              In the yellow cafes at night he&rsquo;'d daub away the time<br>
              But everybody thought him mad, his ear not worth a dime </p>
            <p>He lived in an asylum, he wrote letters to Theo<br>
              And then one day he shot himself, it&rsquo;s adios Van Gogh<br>
              If he were still alive and kicking today<br>
              Vincent&rsquo;s ear would be up for auction on eBay</p>
